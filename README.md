## Simple Commerce

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Simple Commerce is a simple, yet powerful e-commerce addon for Statamic. You have complete control over the content structure and front-end of your site.

### Everything's just an entry

Stay with what you love - Statamic entries. With Simple Commerce, all of your products, orders, customers & coupons are Statamic entries. Giving you the flexibility you need to build bespoke e-commerce sites for your clients.

### Payment gateways

Out-of-the-box, Simple Commerce ships with support for three of the big payment gateways: Stripe, PayPal and Mollie. Use whichever one you need, or if you need something else: it's easy to build one.

### Flexible shipping

Provide your customers with different shipping options depending on their address.

### Discounting

Simple Commerce has support for discount coupons. You can limit coupons to certain products or to be used a max number of times. All your customer has to do is redeem the discount during checkout.

### Product variants

Sometimes you need to sell different versions of the same product. Like a t-shirt, you might want to sell it in Small, Medium & Large - each with different prices and stock levels. That's where Product Variants come in. Create a single product and configure the variants inside it.

### Multi-site friendly

If you need to sell across different countries, you can take advantage of Statamic's multi-site feature in Simple Commerce to have a site per currency. Each site may also have its own set of shipping methods.
