# Permissions

You might want certain people to only be able to access a certain part of Commerce. For example, you might want your marketing team to only access sales or products or you might want your fulfilment staff to only be able to access orders and customers. Simple Commerce allows for this.

When choosing roles for Roles in Statamic, you can add granular control over what your users can access.
