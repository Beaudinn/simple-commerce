# Contributing
Thanks for taking time to contribute to Simple Commerce, really appreciate it!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Simple Commerce. These are not rules, just friendly guidelines.

## What to know before contributing

### Simple Commerce ain't FOSS
Let's get this over and done with - Simple Commerce is **proprietary software**. Everything in this repo, including code by contributors is the property of Duncan McClean (Double Three Digital).

This means there are some limitation on what you can do with the code:
* You can't change anything that would hurt our business model.
* You can't publicly maintain a long-term fork of Simple Commerce.

### How to get support
If you want official Simple Commerce support (and you are the proud owner of a Simple Commerce license), please go to [doublethree.digital/contact](https://doublethree.digital/contact) and we'll try our best to reply as soon as possible.

If you want to report a bug or request a feature, please create an issue on the [doublethreedigital/simple-commerce](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/simple-commerce) repo.

Otherwise, you can chat with other Simple Commerce developers on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hYQxFPK).

## How you can contribute

### Which repos which?
To help keep things neat and tidy, Simple Commerce is split into a few different repos.

* `[doublethreedigital/simple-commerce](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/simple-commerce)` is the core of Simple Commerce. It's the thing every Simple Commerce store needs to function.
* `[doublethreedigital/simple-commerce-stripe](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/simple-commerce-stripe)` is the official Stripe gateway for Simple Commerce

### Where should I report bugs?
If a bug is related to security, please [get in touch directly](https://doublethree.digital/contact) instead of opening an issue.

If it's not security related, please check that there's not already a similar issue already open. If there is, add a `üëç` reaction so we know how many people are having the issue.

Otherwise, [create an issue](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/simple-commerce/issues/new/choose). We'd appreciate it if you could give as much information as possible and follow the provided issue template so it's easy for us to understand, and hopefully fix.

### Feature Request
We'd appreciate if you could [create an issue](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/simple-commerce/issues/new/choose) for any feature requests you have.

### Documentation Edits
At this time, the Simple Commerce documentation is currently in a private repo. We'll see about open-sourcing it at some point.

### Compiled Assets
If you're submitting a change, please don't submit the compiled versions of JavaScript and CSS. We'll do that ourselves after we've merged your code in (for security reasons).

### Pull requests
When submitting a pull request, please clearly describe the problem and solution. Also, include the relevent issue number(s) if there is one.
